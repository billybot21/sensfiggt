# Bad Time Simulator (Sans Fight)
This project is a fork of [Bad Time Simulator](https://github.com/Jcw87/c2-sans-fight!) by Jcw87. this is just a stupid experiment. 
# [Documentation and stuff](Documentation/README.MD)
# Known Issues ------------
- Heart hitbox is probably not accurate.
- On the sans_platforms4 and sans_platforms4hard attacks, the platform is supposed to accelerate from 0 to its full speed, but I was lazy and started it at full speed immediately. This is only a problem if you try to dodge the bones without jumping.
- Sans dialog is missing. I may add something at some future date, but I have no intention of putting the original text in, as it really only makes sense in the context of the whole game.
- # new stuff.
- new music. 
- new colors?
